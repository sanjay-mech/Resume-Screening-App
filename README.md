# Resume-Screening-App
Resume Screening App With Python and Machine Learning 
I designed a resume screening application that combines k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and natural language processing (NLP) to categorize resumes based on their content. The app is a powerful tool for HR professionals and recruiters, enabling them to efficiently match candidates with job openings that align with their skills and qualifications.
Using KNN, the app compares the input resume with a dataset of categorized resumes, determining the closest matches based on content and context. The NLP component processes resume text to extract key features, ensuring accurate classification even with complex or diverse information.
This innovative tool streamlines the resume screening process, saving time and resources while improving the quality of candidate matches. It offers a reliable and efficient solution for optimizing the recruitment process and enhancing candidate selection.
